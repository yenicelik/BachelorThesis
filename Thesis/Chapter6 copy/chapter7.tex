\section{Summary}
We did this and this happened

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Uniform benchmarking methods}
We realized that there is no common benchmark to measure the algorithms determined by gaussian processes, as is the case for e.g. neural networks. 
It would draw competition, and allow for a quantiative and simple comparison of different methods.
Such a benchmark environment should include synthetic functions, but also real datasets.

\subsection{Uniform metric that defines when a BO algorithm performs well}
