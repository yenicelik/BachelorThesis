\section{Main Contributions}
I present this thesis as a result of a systematic treatment of the topic "Bayesian Optimization in High Dimensions".

After doing a throughout literature review, I was able to identify shortcomings of current methods.
Together with my supervisors, were able to come up with the new algorithm "BORING" that improves on the state-of-the-art for Bayesian Optimization algorithms that are able to identify the subspace projection matrix as part of the optimization procedure.
In contrast to other algorithms that solely focus on finding a projection, "BORING" takes into consideration smaller perturbations, and makes the GP process more robust by allowing addition projection matrices to optimize over other axis of the subspace. \\

\section{Conclusion}

Our empirical results show that "BORING" provides a new state-of-the-art for Bayesian Optimization algorithms that use subspace projection as the main feature.
This allows for interpretable future work
