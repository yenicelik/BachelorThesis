\chapter{Introduction}

Tuning hyperparameters is considered a computationally intensive and tedious task, be it for neural networks, or complex physical instruments such as free electron lasers.
Users for such applications could benefit from a 'one-click-search' feature, which would find optimal parameters in as few function evaluations as possible.
This project aims to find such an algorithm which is both efficient and holds certain convergence guarantees.
We focus our efforts on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and revise techniques for high-dimensional BO. \\

In Bayesian Optimization, we want to use a Gaussian Process to find an optimal parameter setting $\mathbf{x^*}$ that maximizes a given utility function $f$.
The procedure consists of 1. generating such a surrogate surface, using Gaussian Processes, and 2. applying an acquisition function.
The acquisition function allows for a tradeoff between exploitation of the best found global maximum so far, and exploration - searching for a configuration $x$ whose neighborhood was not picked yet.\\
