The main topic of this thesis is how to conduct bayesian optimization in high dimensional domains. 
Although high dimensional domains can be defined to be between 100 and 1000 dimensions, we will primarily focus on optimization problem that occur in 5 to 30 dimensions.
As such, we focus on practical solutions to common problems that can be solved without owning a supercomputer (although extensions to higher dimensions are just as well possible).




This is where you write your abstract ...
