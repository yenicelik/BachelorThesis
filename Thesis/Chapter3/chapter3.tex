\section{Biggest competitors}
Some main competitors are:

\subsection{REMBO}

\subsection{Linear embeddings for Gaussian processes}
And now I begin my third chapter here \dots

And now to cite some more people~\citet{Rea85,Ancey1996}

\subsection{Synthetic Datasets}
\paragraph{5 dimensional function with 2 dimensional linear embedding}

It is easy to test snythetic datasets, as we can evaluate these functions at any point, and immediately get a regret value.

\paragraph{2D to 1D}: For this function, we use a simple Parabola which is embedded in a 2D space.
\paragraph{5D to 1D}: For this function, we use a simple Parabola which is embedded in a 5D space.
\paragraph{5D to 2D}: For this function, we use a simple Camelback function which is embedded in a 5D space.
\paragraph{10D to 5D}: For this function, we use the 5D Rosenbrock functoin which is embedded in a 10D space.

\subsection{Real Datasets}
It is more difficult to test algorithms on real datasets, as we cannot quite test a metric such as regret, but rather have to use log likelihood or something similar to test how well our algorithm adapts on a test set, given a training set.

\paragraph{SwissFEL dataset}
\dots and some more
